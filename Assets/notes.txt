thicker bucket so you cant fly through
invisible rectangle inside to be the win trigger
more frequent obstacles, slower speed? needs tweaking.
include bucket on both sides
maybe start with the speed slow then increase later or with permanent speed boosts
  make it a spinning transparent card that has some up arrows
  could also include some that have down arrows, to slow you down.
    lose if your speed drops below some amount (show a message that says "too slow")
increase size of collider for triangle to ensure boosting can happen..?
  add extra of itself, larger/invisible to prefab
redo prefabs probably
figure out why bouncing? (meh its a feature)

boss fight - Blockus
  figure out how to export that sweet material from inventor
  or get material for blockus elsewhere (ask mike)
  once you land in a bucket, it actually just teleports you 
    into a huge version of that bucket where you fight blockus.
    OR it is the same exact box you landed in except you shrink 
    to like 1/100 and summon blockus on trigger (halfway into the bucket?)
      probably easier to just load a new scene, falling in to the huge bucket with blockus
    Enough hits (somewhere,somehow) and it breaks apart..
    ..summoning two (identical size?) in its place! High score wins.
    maybe you have to just hit it and if you hit the sides you get hurt
    3 hits to each blockus or 4? will have to test

two different game modes basically - count seconds for how long you can stay on the course
and count time alive and how many blockuses get killed in the other mode

different shaped buckets will be different bosses
more obstacles on the path
  moving obstacles

generate a platform like 500 up, just covered in dick trees
  maybe dont trigger generation of this platform until the player reaches 500 Y, then start coroutine

be able to pick the color of your spherus (maybe this can be unlocked, different colors for different bosses? like n game)
