thicker bucket so you cant fly through
invisible rectangle inside to be the win trigger
more frequent obstacles, slower speed? needs tweaking.
include bucket on both sides
maybe start with the speed slow then increase later or with permanent speed boosts
  make it a spinning transparent card that has some up arrows
  could also include some that have down arrows, to slow you down.
    lose if your speed drops below some amount (show a message that says "too slow")
increase size of collider for triangle to ensure boosting can happen..?
  add extra of itself, larger/invisible to prefab
redo prefabs probably
figure out why bouncing? (meh its a feature)

boss fight - Blockus
  figure out how to export that sweet material from inventor
  or get material for blockus elsewhere (ask mike)
